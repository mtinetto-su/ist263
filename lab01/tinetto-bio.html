    My name is Marco Tinetto, I am a Psychology major interested in the social aspect of why people behave the way they do.  I was born and raised in Switzerland and speak French, English, Spanish, and Italian fluently.  Throughout my high school years, I played professional Baseball on the Swiss National Team where I got to travel all over Europe and compete in European tournaments. After graduation I moved to the United States by myself freshman year of college as I decided to pursue my career in America.  Once in the united states the door for opportunities was wide open and I was eager to get started.  I joined a radio station, which I am still part of today,  where I run my own 2 hour radio show every Monday which I am the lead host of.
